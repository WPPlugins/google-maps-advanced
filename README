Notes:
	- Google Maps API v.2 is used
	- Your site should be UTF-8 encoded (although the plugin SHOULD work for other encodings)
		There is a problem with IE for Windows on Japanese Windows systems when page
		encoding is not set to UTF-8, but to ShiftJIS (errors, map is not loaded). Switch
		your page encoding to UTF-8 to fix the problem.

Using:
	On the post editor:
	1. write some text, glue some image
	2. select it and create a regular link
	3. if you manually edit the <a> tag putting class="something" or
	   style="somestyle", these attributes will be inherited by the map
	4. on the Title field of the Create Link dialog put "googlemap" and some
	   controls separated by ';'
	5. For compatibility with other plugins, you can also use the rel=""
	   attribute instead of title="". You'll have to manually edit the HTML
	   though.

	Other controls are:
	w:SOMEWIDTH or w:SOMEWIDTH%
	h:SOMEHEIGHT or h:SOMEHEIGHT%
	nocontrols
	nomarker

	Examples for the Title (or rel) field:
	googlemap;w:300;h:500 (renders a 300x500 map with controls and marker)
	googlemap;w:500;nomarker (renders a 500xDEFAULTHEIGHT map with controls and no marker)
	googlemap;w:300;h:500;nomarker;nocontrols (renders a 300x500 map without controls nor marker)





Using on complex maps:

1. Create a definition list (<dl>) and put map-related commands and parameters on title= attribute as specified above.
2. First definition term (<dt>, first green line) must contain only a link to Google Maps site, to define its center and other map parameters. The text for the link is ignored when a map is generated, so use a text like “Center of Map” so people accessing your posts outside your blog (for exemple, through feed readers) will have a clue what is this link for.
3. The rest is a pair of terms and definitions (<dt> and <dd>) with the marker position (as a Google Maps URL) and the text on the balloon respectivelly.
4. You can create a balloonless markers specifying only a <dt> without a <dd>.
5. Whatever you put inside the <dd> block will appear inside the balloon. Put links, images, lists, tables, etc.
