This plugin will let you easily render Google Maps anywhere on your blog as a web service.

== Description ==

This is the most complete and advanced Google Maps plugin to be used in your WordPress blog or any other content manager or even plain HTML pages.

It helps you very easily insert simple to complex Google Maps in your pages from a plain Google Maps URL, remote or local KML file or even [making your own map manually to show multiple markers with baloons containing rich text and images](http://avi.alkalay.net/2006/11/google-maps-plugin-for-wordpress.html#complex).

This plugin works in a non-intrusive way keeping your markup clean and simple. It also works in a semantic way, adding and inheriting appropriate CSS style from your markup letting advanced bloggers keep a clean yet advancd code.

Each map can be configured with the [plugin's simple parameters](http://avi.alkalay.net/2006/11/google-maps-plugin-for-wordpress.html#attributes) that can be inserted while pasting links in WordPress rich editor.

As an addon, you get for free a code that is clean, object-oriented and fully documented.
